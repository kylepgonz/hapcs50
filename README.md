Project Name: Hap
Members: Kyle Gonzales, Lucas Qiang Wei

We created a website on which users can browse, search and RSVP for upcoming events around Yale. Users can also create new events.

The webpages are designed and created by HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and GO language. You may need to install a Go compiler in order to run it. Instructions for downloading and installing the Go compilers, tools, and libraries please check https://golang.org/doc/ .

Once done, run “go build-mod vendor” through your command line in the main project folder to compile our project and then run “./classproject” or “./classproject.exe” on Windows in order to run the app. Preview the app by visiting http://localhost:8080 if you're running it locally. And we also have deployed our website to Heroku you can visit this link https://hapcs50.herokuapp.com to check our website. 

Our site also includes an API which is in JSON  format to extract events data. You can visit it at /api/events.
