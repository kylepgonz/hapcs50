\f0\fs24 \cf0 We created a website on which users can browse, search and RSVP for upcoming events around Yale. Users can also create new events.\
\
The webpages are designed and created by HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and GO language. You may need to install a Go compiler in order to run it. Instructions for downloading and installing the Go compilers, tools, and libraries please check {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://golang.org/doc/"}}{\fldrslt 
\f1 \cf2 \ul \ulc2 https://golang.org/doc/}}
\f1  .\
\

\f0 Once done, run \'93go build-mod vendor\'94 through your command line in the main project folder to compile our project and then run \'93./classproject\'94 or \'93./classproject.exe\'94 on Windows in order to run the app. Preview the app by visiting http://localhost:8080 if you're running it locally. And we also have deployed our website to Heroku you can visit this link \cf2 \ul \ulc2 https://hapcs50.herokuapp.com\cf0 \ulnone  to check our website. \
\
Our site also includes an API which is in JSON  format to extract events data. You can visit it at /api/events
